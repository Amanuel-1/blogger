Working on overhauling the front-end development process for all projects at [Villvay](https://villvay.com/) introducing standards and quality checks such as [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and standardizing library use among projects such as using libraries like [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for async state management rather than Redux.
